        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I am a recent graduate with distinction from Varsity College. <br> 
            I studied a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science in Application Development.<br>
            I have always found the field of Technology fascinating and can't wait to learn more about it.

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="WebDev">I have recently started the full-stack Web Development course. <br>
           Even though I have faced a few challenged, I have found it <br>
           fascinating to figure out and solve these challenges. Once I have <br>
           completed this course, I am looking to do more courses in Cyber <br>
           Security, Cloud Computing, and Business Analyst. In High School <br>
           I also did CAT for 3 years and was the top student at the end of Grade 12. <br>

        <p class="KnittingText">
            Ever since the age of 11, I have enjoyed knitting. I asked my <br>
            mom to teach me and ever since, I have loved it. Even though I <br>
            might not be a professional, I still believe I am pretty good at it ;) <br>
            I have mostly only created blankets, but now I am trying to learn <br>
            how to create different things such as a jersey or beanie.
